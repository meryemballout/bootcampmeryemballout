#Instructions
#This project allows users to take a quiz to test their Star Wars knowledge.
#The number of correct/incorrect answers are tracked and the user receives different messages depending on how well they did on the quiz.

#Here is an array of dictionaries, containing those questions and answers

#data = [
    #{
    #    "question": "What is Baby Yoda's real name?",
    #    "answer": "Grogu"
    #},
    #{
     #   "question": "Where did Obi-Wan take Luke after his birth?",
      #  "answer": "Tatooine"
    #"},
    #{
    #"   "question": "What year did the first Star Wars movie come out?",
    #    "answer": "1977"
    #},
    #{
     #   "question": "Who built C-3PO?",
    #    "answer": "Anakin Skywalker"
    #},
    #{
     #   "question": "Anakin Skywalker grew up to be who?",
      #  "answer": "Darth Vader"
    #},
    #{
     #   "question": "What species is Chewbacca?",
      #  "answer": "Wookiee"
    #}
#]


#Create a function that asks the questions to the user, and check his answers. Track the number of correct, incorrect answers. Create a list of wrong_answers
#Create a function that informs the user of his number of correct/incorrect answers.
#Bonus : display to the user the questions he answered wrong, his answer, and the correct answer.
#If he had more then 3 wrong answers, ask him to play again.
