#ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Cinemax #2
#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
#if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
#if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
#if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.
#Given the following object:
#family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}
#How much does each family member have to pay ?
#Print out the familyâ€™s total cost for the movies.
#Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the provided family variable (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary that is initially empty).
