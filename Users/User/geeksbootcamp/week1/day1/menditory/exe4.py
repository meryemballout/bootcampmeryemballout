#1 Write code that will ask the user for their height in centimeters.

#2 If they are over 145cm print a message that states they are tall enough to ride.
# If they are not tall enough print a message that says they need to grow some more to ride.
height_cm = input("Enter your height in centimeters: ") 
height_cm = int(height_cm)  
if height_cm > 145:
    print("You  are tall enough to ride!")
